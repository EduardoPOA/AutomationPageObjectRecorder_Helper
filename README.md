# AutomationPageObjectRecorder_Helper
These projects are auxiliary to help you debug as there is no way to debug the original project.

# Attention
These projects are auxiliary to be able to debug because there is no way to debug the original project, despite the original project presenting plugins with legacies from 10 years ago so it was the only way to achieve a strategy of being able to debug separately.
